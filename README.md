# hello-express

This is an app that allows for the creation of basic staff notation in SVG format.


## To Do

Continue grouping improvements:
- ledger lines with their notes
- ~~handle chords with seconds~~ (mostly done)
- connect accidentals with their notes
- deal with erasing something within a group

Additions:
- ~~flags~~
- ~~C clefs~~
- ~~different barline types~~
- ~~multiple beams~~ (needs a little bit of editing)
- dynamics
- slurs
- articulations

Structural things:
- allow import of an svg already in progress?
- allow saving of pages at a unique url?
- real-time collaboration (now exists! only one room though)
- export to MEI
- allow undo
